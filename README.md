# ðŸ“ˆ Real-Time Stock Price Anomaly Detector

This project is part of the **Techsophy Coding Assessment**. It is a Python-based real-time anomaly detection system for stock prices using live financial data. The system fetches stock prices at regular intervals and uses statistical methods to detect abnormal price movements (anomalies).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To design a real-time application that:
- Monitors live stock prices
- Detects unusual price changes using statistical thresholds
- Alerts the user via console and logs
- Visualizes the anomalies in price charts

---

## ðŸ§  Features

- âœ… Real-time monitoring of multiple stock tickers
- ðŸ“Š Statistical anomaly detection using:
  - Moving Average (MA)
  - Standard Deviation (STD)
  - Z-score thresholding
- ðŸ”” Console alerts for anomalies
- ðŸ§¾ Logs alerts to a text file (`alerts_log.txt`)
- ðŸ“ˆ Anomaly plots using `matplotlib`
- ðŸ§¹ Clean and modular code (easy to extend to LSTM in future)
